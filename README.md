# Pandas Tutorial
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.\
This repository contains a number of solved hands-on challenges from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) that helps to master data science skills.


## Prerequisites
The Code is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.
